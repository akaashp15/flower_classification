This project is was designed to introduce myself to classifcation in Tensorflow and is heavily derived from the the TensorFlow flower classification tutorial and well as the Gradio documentation on creating an application. There is a Gradio app where you can upload your own image to test out my classification model! The model is not perfect by any means and only has minimal tuning/validation, but this is intended to show the full end-to-end possibilities of image classification.
